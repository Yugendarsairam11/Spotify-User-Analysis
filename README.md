# Spotify-User-Analysis

ðŸš€ Project Overview: 
In this personal venture, I dived into the world of data, using SQL as my compass. My objective was to unearth valuable insights by tackling a range of compelling questions, all within the realm of user engagement and behavior.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Questions Explored:

1. Daily User Activity: 
My exploration began with an analysis to discover the total active users each day, painting a vivid picture of daily engagement trends.

2. Weekly Engagement Trends: 
Building on the daily insights, I used SQL to extend the analysis to weekly activity patterns, offering a broader view of user engagement.

3. Conversion Dynamics: 
I delved into the data to identify users who installed the app and made a purchase on the same day. This analysis provided valuable insights into the user acquisition and conversion process.

4. Regional Insights: 
Using SQL, I calculated the percentage of paid users in India, the USA, and other countries. This geographic segmentation allowed me to tailor strategies for different regions.

5. Conversion Timelines: 
My journey concluded with a detailed examination of users who installed the app and made in-app purchases the very next day. This data revealed valuable conversion timing patterns.

âœ¨ Personal Growth: 
This personal project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and skill development. It showcases my ability to use SQL to transform data into actionable insights, ultimately contributing to data-informed decisions.
